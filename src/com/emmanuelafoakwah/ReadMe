This project is an implementation of the underlying functionality of a T9 style predictive text system. The basic goal
of the system is to allow a primarily numerical 0-9 keyboard to be used to generate words. This is achieved through
taking the numerical "signatures" that can be entered by a T9 style 0-9 keyboard and referencing a dictionary (of words)
to return all the words that correspond to that signature. The user would then be able to select the word they intend
to add to their message.

The project is split into 4 implementations, some building on aspects of previous implementations:
1) Prototype - sets up basic functionality, reads dictionary straight from .txt file
2) List Implementation - loads .txt dictionary into a list
3) Map Implementation - loads .txt dictionary into a map
4) Tree Implementation - loads .txt dictionary into a tree, capable of matching partial words (uses custom octree implementation)

The project assumes the following keyboard configuration:

1 -         2 - abc     3 - def
4 - ghi     5 - jkl     6 - mno
7 - pqrs    8 - tuv     9 - wxyz
